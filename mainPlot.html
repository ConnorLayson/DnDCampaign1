        <h1>Session One</h1>
        <p>
            Tanner & Dylan are roommates on an earth-like Planet
            in a boring as fuck town. Nothing ever happens, until 
            they wake up to the whole house shaking. As they look 
            outside, the local city malitia is marching toward 
            their house to tear it down. As they go outside, their
            friends (Whom they don't have the faintest idea are from
            another planet), Laz, Zeph, & Jose, come around the corner
            and are trying to tell them [Tanner and Dylan] something
            important: A fleet of Jargon constructor ships are in-route
            to destroy the entire planet! The aliens are attempting to 
            convince Tanner & Dylan that their house doesn't matter in 
            the grand scheme of it all. The rest of the session should
            be the party introducing themselves and hitchhiking off the 
            planet using a patent-pending hitchhiking device that
            transmats them to the Jargon constructor fleet.
